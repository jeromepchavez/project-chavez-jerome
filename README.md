# Jerome's Portfolio Project

[Link to Page](https://jeromepchavez.github.io/project-chavez-jerome/)

This is my project for CS290

I plan on using this project to create a portfolio website for myself. 

This will be a place I can showcase the skills that I've learned from school and also on my own learning.

Overtime, I hope to add more features as I learn them and eventually make this project something that I present to potential
employers.
