# Jerome's Portfolio Project
This is my project for CS290

I plan on using this project to create a portfolio website for myself. 

This will be a place I can showcase the skills that I've learned from school and also on my own learning.

Overtime, I hope to add more features as I learn them and eventually make this project something that I present to potential
employers.
